# ansible

This repo will get some recepies for ansible that I intend to learn to use for remote administration of my different servers instances. 

# TODO list (WIP) 

At the very least I need: 

## [ ] - dotfiles install 

## [ ] - emacs and .emacs install 

## [ ] - julia install and package compilation 

Aim: to be able to afk whe, julia does this, instead of in from of julia promp waiting after issuing a "using XXX" command
